So this is a little project I'm working on with my neighbor to turn a Rasbperry Pi into a web-enabled door controller for an apartment. It'll consist of a simple web server (this) that will run on the Pi and interface with a simple AC switching circuit. I'm also gonna try to build companion mobile apps.
